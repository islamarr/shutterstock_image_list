About this project
--------------
ðŸš€ List of awesome pictures from ShutterStock.

ðŸ›  Simple implementation for MVVM architecture pattern and clean code.

ðŸ›  SOLID principles.

ðŸ›  Unit tests included.

ðŸ›  Standard Coding Style.

ðŸ›  Support Tablet screens.



Architecture pattern Used
--------------
[MVVM][1]

![architecture pattern][2]

Libraries Used
--------------

* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
* [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
    * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
    * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
    * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
    * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
    * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
      asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
    * [Repository][3] - A Module that handle data operations, You can consider repositories to be mediators between different data sources.
    * [Kotlin Flows][21] - A stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
    * [Paging 3][22] - For loading and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network.
* Third party and miscellaneous libraries
    * [Retrofit][20] - A simple library that is used for network transaction.
    * [Glide][90] For image loading.
    * [Hilt][92]: For [dependency injection][93]
    * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] For managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.

Technical choices
--------------
**MVVM**
- Loose coupling between View & ViewModel, ViewModel has no reference to the View. So it isn't affected by configuration changes.
- Aware by lifecycle. ViewModel save data even after rotate mobile.
- Easy to Test.

**RecyclerView**
- In RecyclerView, it is mandatory to use ViewHolder pattern Which optimize the performance.
- DiffUtil callback Which optimize the performance.

**Activities vs Fragments**

- I have used a single-activity architecture which allowed me to take full advantage of the Navigation component, which mean that a single activity that manages and host multiple fragments.
- The fragment is more lite weight than Activity.

**Hilt vs Dagger2 vs Koin**

- Hilt is built on top of the Dagger, and it comes with some advantages like simplify Dagger code and create a standard set of components and scopes to ease setup.
- Hilt does not need factories for ViewModel, koin need.
- Hilt generate the code in the compile time, while koin in runtime. 

**Glide**

- Glide very effective for almost any case where you need to fetch, resize, cache and display a remote image.
- Support round pictures, thumbnail and placeholder which I needed in this project.


What's next
--------------
- I wish I could have implemented caching data, but found problems that will take some time, 
  so maybe complete it in the coming iteration.
- Also the UI needs to be much fancier.
- Unit tests are still need to be written.
- I wish I could have extend it to Clean Architecture, maybe update it in the coming iteration.
